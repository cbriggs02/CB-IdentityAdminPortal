# CB-IdentityAdminPortal

A secure and modular Angular application designed for managing identity, users, and roles. This admin portal communicates with the IdentityServiceApi (ASP.NET Core Web API) for managing user authentication and role-based access control. Built using modern front-end practices, this portal is scalable, maintainable, and integrates well with DevOps workflows.

## Overview

The CB-IdentityAdminPortal is a web-based application that allows administrators to manage user identities, roles, and permissions. It communicates with a secure ASP.NET Core Web API backend for performing operations such as login, user management, and role assignment.
This portal is built with Angular, leveraging Node.js, Yarn, and modern front-end technologies. The app ensures a modular design and a smooth user experience.
